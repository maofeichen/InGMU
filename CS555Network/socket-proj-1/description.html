<font color="#886633">Project 1: A Conferencing Application</font></h2></center>
A <font color="#3366FF">conference&nbsp; server</font> is&nbsp; an application&nbsp;
program&nbsp; that&nbsp; enables conversation&nbsp;&nbsp; between&nbsp;
multiple&nbsp; <font color="#3366FF">conference clients</font>.&nbsp; Clients
connect&nbsp; to the server&nbsp; and all&nbsp; the connected&nbsp; clients
receive&nbsp; all the messages transmitted by any of&nbsp; the clients.
This group communication is facilitated by the&nbsp; conference server.
A client reads&nbsp; the text typed by the user&nbsp; and sends it&nbsp;
to the server.&nbsp; It is the responsibility&nbsp; of the server to relay
that text to&nbsp; all the other clients. The clients receive the text
relayed by the server and display it on the screen.
<p>You need to write two programs: <font color="#3366FF">confserver</font>
and <font color="#3366FF">confclient</font>. The BSD sockets are used&nbsp;
for communication between the client and server. The functionality of each
of these programs is described below.
<h4>
confserver</h4>

<div CLASS="source">
<h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; usage : confserver</h5>
</div>
The server first creates a socket using&nbsp; the <i><font color="#3366FF">socket()</font></i>
system call. It then binds its address to the socket using the <i><font color="#3366FF">bind()</font></i>
system call. It <font color="#3366FF">specfies the port number as 0 </font>which
allows the system to assign an unused port number for the server. The assigned
port number is displayed on the screen. Then <i><font color="#3366FF">listen()
</font></i>call is used to indicate that the server is now ready to receive
connect requests.
<p>The server's job is wait for either connect/disconnect requests or messages
from clients. If it receives a connect request, it accepts the connection
and adds it&nbsp; to the list of established&nbsp; connections which it
has&nbsp; to monitor&nbsp; for messages.&nbsp; If it receives a disconnect
request,&nbsp; it closes the connection and removes the client from the
list of established connections. Otherwise, it forwards the message to
all other clients. This monitoring of events from several connections can
be performed by using <i><font color="#3366FF">select()</font></i> system
call.
<h4>
confclient</h4>

<div CLASS="source">
<h5>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font size=-1>usage : confclient <i>&lt;servhost> &lt;servport></i></font></h5>
</div>
The client first creates a socket using the <i><font color="#3366FF">socket()</font></i>
system call.&nbsp; It then connects to the server using the <i><font color="#3366FF">connect()</font></i>
system call. The whereabouts of the server are passed as command line arguments.
<p>One the connection is established, the client's job&nbsp; is to&nbsp;
wait&nbsp; for either&nbsp; user&nbsp; input from&nbsp; the keyboard or
messages from the server. Inputs from the user are sent to the sever and
the messages from the server are displayed on the screen. Once again, <i><font color="#3366FF">select()
</font></i>call is used for monitoring the input from keyboard and socket.
